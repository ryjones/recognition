# On Recognition

There are many ways to recognize people for the contributions they make - one of [my personal favorite ones is a comment in the NTPd source code](https://github.com/ntp-project/ntp/blob/9c75327c3796ff59ac648478cd4da8b205bceb77/ntpd/ntp_control.c#L3807). At the Hyperledger Foundation, we've [issued badges](https://www.credly.com/badges/f0112709-7a9c-429e-83e4-b2322c5f1258/public_url), given [poker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryjones/recognition/main/2020.jpg) [chips](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryjones/recognition/main/2019.jpg) for events and [other](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryjones/recognition/main/token-obverse.jpg) [contributions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryjones/recognition/main/token-reverse.jpg), as well as stickers and shirts.

In 2021, we ordered some [contributor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryjones/recognition/main/2021-obverse.jpg) [coins](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryjones/recognition/main/2021-reverse.jpg) - an idea long championed by our current TSC chair, [Tracy Kuhrt](https://github.com/tkuhrt). For 2022, we went with a [two](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryjones/recognition/main/2022-obverse.jpg)-[colored](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryjones/recognition/main/2022-reverse.jpg) coin. For special occasions, we've also engraved them for contributors - like [Danno Ferrin](https://youtu.be/aGe-ry7AbAw), our TSC Vice Chair.
